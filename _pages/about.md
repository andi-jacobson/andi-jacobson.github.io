[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://andi-jacobson.github.io/files/AndreaJacobsonResume.pdf)

I am a second year PhD student in both the Fessler and fMRI labs at the University of Michigan. I study combined diffusion relaxometry MRI, with a goal to find ways to specifically differentiate different types of brain lesions that are generally found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. Outside of my academics, I enjoy leading community service projects and university events. At my undergraduate university, Indiana University, Purdue University - Indianapolis (now renamed Purdue University, Indianapolis) I founded an award-winning student organization called the Domestic Abuse Prevention Student Organization (est. 2019) where I and over 150+ members worked to fulfill our mission to “support survivors of domestic abuse through volunteer work and advocacy”. Now at the University of Michigan, I enjoy volunteering weekly for End The Cycle, a student group that provides tutoring for high school and middle school students who have recently experienced housing instability or homelessness. Additionally, I serve as the president for the American Society of Engineering Education, the chair of Academic Affairs for the Graduate Student Council, and a committee member for the DEI mental health committee.
